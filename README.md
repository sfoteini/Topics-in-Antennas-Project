# Topics in Antennas – Antennas Synthesis

This assignment was part of the course Topics in Antennas – Antennas Synthesis (Electrical and Computer Engineering Department, Aristotle University of Thessaloniki, 8th semester).

The project is divided into two parts:

*	**Part 1**: Computational analysis of discone antenna and helical antenna using the 4nec2 software
*	**Part 2**: Implementation of the MVDR beamforming algorithm and the MUSIC direction-of-arrival algorithm using MATLAB

*The report is in Greek.*
